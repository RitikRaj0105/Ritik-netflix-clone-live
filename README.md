Introduction
Welcome to Netflix-Clone, the front-end part of a web application that replicates the popular video streaming platform, Netflix. This project focuses on providing users with a familiar and enjoyable streaming experience, allowing them to watch their favorite movies and TV shows in a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.

Streaming platforms have become an integral part of modern-day entertainment, and Netflix, in particular, has revolutionized the way we consume media. While this project aims to recreate the look and feel of Netflix, it is purely an educational endeavor and an opportunity to showcase front-end web development skills.

Features
The Netflix-Clone front-end project aims to include the following key features:

User Interface: The application will offer a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, resembling the design and layout of Netflix. Users should feel comfortable navigating through the app and discovering new content.

Movie/TV Show Cards: Content will be displayed as cards, showcasing the title, poster, and relevant information. These cards should be interactive and lead users to more details or the playback screen.

Browsing and Search: Users will be able to explore a vast collection of movies and TV shows, organized by genres and categories. Additionally, a search functionality will enable users to find specific titles easily.

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the front-end is responsive is crucial to accommodate users on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The layout should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Video Playback Interface: A well-designed video playback interface will be integrated to offer users a smooth and immersive viewing experience. Playback controls, full-screen mode, and video quality options should be included.
